# virtual_screening_OA
Host-guest datasets involving OA derivatives as a testing bed for virtual screening tools. 

The parameters folder gives structures of individual molecules and atomic charges used in end-point simulations. 

_dock folders give bound structures produced by seven docking protocols. 

End-point sampling parameters include the constant-volume heating in 120 ps, NPT equilibration for 1 ns, and 1000 ns unbiased sampling in the host-guest and unbound guest states and 10000 ns for the unbound host state, with a sampling interval of 10 ps.
